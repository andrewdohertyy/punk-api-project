<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Welcome to my latest project "Punk-API"</h2>

<p align="center">This project was up to now my favourite as going into it react seemed so difficult. However coming towards then end of the project i had recapped alot of what i learnt and fully seen the benefits of using react to create a webpage.

My favourite part was adding routes to the page and getting it to display a new link on button click. As well as this i really emjoyed the styling and took inspiration from the brewdog website. I got the search and filters to work suprisingly easily having just learnt this which i am very proud of too. 

What i will add in the future is multiple pages, so if the user wanted to see more beers then can have page 2, page 3 etc. On the more info page i would also like to implement a previous/next option so the user can search through them all. Also to have more tests for DOM specific events.


Enjoy my project! </p>
